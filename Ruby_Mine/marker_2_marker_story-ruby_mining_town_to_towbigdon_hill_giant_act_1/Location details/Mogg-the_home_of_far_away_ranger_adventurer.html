       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow" id="Burg details Resources">
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Source and Habitat: Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that's
primarily composed of carbon, along with various other elements such as hydrogen,
sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. It's formed from the remains of ancient plants that
lived and died in swampy, wetland environments.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Coal is extracted from the ground using mining techniques,
which can range from surface mining to deep underground mining. In this fantasy
world, underground mining might involve the use of creatures adapted to dark,
subterranean environments.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: Once extracted, coal is collected and prepared for transport.
Larger pieces might be broken down to a more manageable size at the mining site.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: Raw coal often requires cleaning to remove impurities. This might be
done at a preparation plant near the mining site. The cleaned coal is then sorted by
size, typically into lump coal and slack.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Coal should be stored in a dry place, as moisture can
degrade its quality and make it less efficient as a fuel. In some cases, coal might
be stored in covered sheds or silos.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Transportation: Coal is typically transported in bulk, often by wagon or ship.
Magical transportation methods might also be used, if available.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Distribution: Coal is often sold directly to industries that use it for heating or
fuel, such as blacksmiths or pottery kilns. It can also be sold at marketplaces or
traded for other goods.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Usage: Coal is primarily used as a fuel source. It can provide heat for homes and
industries, and can be used in the production of steel and other materials. It might
also have magical applications, such as powering enchantments or alchemical
processes.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: While coal is abundant, it is a non-renewable resource. Extraction
must be managed responsibly to ensure long-term availability, and to minimize
environmental damage such as land degradation and pollution.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: Coal mining and trade is a significant economic activity, providing
jobs for miners, transporters, and industries that rely on coal. The sale and use of
coal can contribute significantly to local and regional economies.

which can be collected regularly, and they grow a new set of feathers every year
that can also be collected.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: Goose eggs can be consumed directly or used in cooking. Feathers need to
be cleaned and can then be used in various crafts, or as quill pens or stuffing for
pillows and mattresses.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">

        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, coffee beans undergo processing methods to remove the
fruit's outer layers and extract the beans. The two primary processing methods are
the dry (natural) method and the wet (washed) method. Each method imparts unique
flavors to the beans.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Coffee beans are stored in a cool, dry place away from
moisture and strong odors. They are often stored in sealed bags or containers to

worldwide. The beans are roasted, ground, and brewed using various methods to
extract the flavors and aromas. Coffee is also used in the production of coffee-
flavored products and ingredients.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Sustainable coffee cultivation involves practices that promote
environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic viability. This
includes shade-grown cultivation, organic farming, fair trade practices, and support
for the well-being of coffee farmers and communities.
        </div>
