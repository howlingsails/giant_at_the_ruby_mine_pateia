        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Source and Habitat: Wheat is a cereal grain that is widely cultivated and consumed
worldwide. It is primarily grown in regions with temperate climates. Common
varieties of wheat include hard wheat, soft wheat, durum wheat, and spelt.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Wheat is cultivated by sowing wheat seeds in prepared
fields. The plants require well-drained soil, moderate temperatures, and appropriate
moisture levels for optimal growth. Wheat plants go through stages of germination,
vegetative growth, flowering, and grain formation.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: Wheat is harvested when the grains have reached maturity and
dried on the stalks. The timing of harvest is crucial to ensure proper grain quality
and minimize losses. Modern combine harvesters are commonly used to efficiently
harvest and separate the grain from the stalks.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, wheat grains go through processing steps to remove the
outer husk and separate the bran and germ from the endosperm. The endosperm is then
ground into flour, which can be further processed to produce different wheat-based
products.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Wheat grains are stored in dry, well-ventilated facilities
to prevent moisture absorption and insect infestation. Flour and wheat-based
products should be stored in airtight containers to maintain their freshness and
prevent spoilage.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Transportation: Transporting wheat involves proper packaging and protection to
prevent damage and maintain grain quality. Wheat grains are typically transported in
bulk using trucks, trains, or ships to milling facilities or storage warehouses.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Distribution: Wheat and wheat-based products are distributed globally and are
essential ingredients in various food products. They are supplied to flour mills,
bakeries, pasta manufacturers, and other food processing companies through local and
international supply chains.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Usage: Wheat is a versatile grain used in a wide range of culinary applications. It
is commonly milled into flour and used for baking bread, pastries, cakes, and other
baked goods. Wheat is also used to make pasta, couscous, breakfast cereals, and
other wheat-based products.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Sustainable wheat cultivation involves implementing environmentally
friendly practices, such as crop rotation, soil conservation, water management, and
responsible pesticide use. Sustainable farming methods aim to reduce the
environmental impact and promote long-term productivity.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: Wheat production and trade have a significant economic impact in
many countries, providing income for farmers, employment opportunities in processing
and manufacturing, and contributing to national and international food markets.
