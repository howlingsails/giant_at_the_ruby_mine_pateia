        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Source and Habitat: Geese are typically found near water bodies like lakes, ponds,
or rivers. They also inhabit grasslands and agricultural areas.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Geese can be domesticated and raised on farms. They require
a habitat with access to water, grassy areas for foraging, and safe nesting places.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: Geese provide a number of renewable resources. They lay eggs
which can be collected regularly, and they grow a new set of feathers every year
that can also be collected.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: Goose eggs can be consumed directly or used in cooking. Feathers need to
be cleaned and can then be used in various crafts, or as quill pens or stuffing for
pillows and mattresses.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Eggs need to be stored in a cool, dry place. They can also
be preserved using various methods, such as pickling. Feathers should be kept dry to
prevent damage.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Transportation: Eggs and feathers are lightweight and relatively easy to transport,
typically in baskets or sacks.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Distribution: Goose eggs and feathers would be sold or traded locally, and could
also be transported to more distant markets.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Usage: Goose eggs are a nutritious food source. Feathers have various uses, from
writing instruments (quills) to insulation in clothing or bedding.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Raising geese can be sustainable as they are a source of renewable
resources (eggs, feathers). However, care must be taken to provide them with a
healthy habitat and not to overexploit them.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: Keeping geese can support a small-scale economy, providing a
livelihood for the farmer and a source of food and craft materials for the
community.

       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow" id="Burg details Resources">
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Source and Habitat: Clay is a type of fine-grained soil or sediment that is found
abundantly in various regions worldwide. It is formed through the weathering and
decomposition of rocks and minerals, typically in areas with ample water and
suitable geological conditions.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Clay is extracted from natural deposits or clay pits through
mining or quarrying. Sustainable clay extraction involves responsible land
management, including reclamation and rehabilitation of extraction sites to minimize
environmental impact.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: The harvesting of clay involves the excavation or removal of
clay deposits from the earth's surface or underground. This can be done using heavy
machinery or manual labor, depending on the scale of clay extraction.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, clay goes through processing steps such as crushing,
grinding, and refining to remove impurities and achieve the desired consistency.
Additional treatments may be applied to enhance the properties of the clay for
specific applications.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Clay is stored in dry conditions and protected from
moisture to prevent it from becoming hard or losing its plasticity. Proper storage
helps maintain the workability and quality of the clay.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Transportation: Transporting clay typically involves loading it into trucks,
containers, or bulk carriers for transport to various destinations. The mode of
transportation depends on the volume and distance of the clay shipment.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Distribution: Clay is distributed globally and is supplied to various industries,
including construction, ceramics, pottery, refractories, and art. It is available
through clay suppliers, building material stores, specialized ceramic studios, and
online platforms.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Usage: Clay is used for a wide range of applications, including pottery, brick and
tile manufacturing, construction materials, sculpture, and art. It can also be used
in geological and scientific studies, as well as in the production of refractories
and catalysts.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Sustainable clay extraction and usage involve responsible land
management, reclamation of extraction sites, and minimizing the environmental impact
of mining activities. Clay can be sourced from renewable deposits, and efforts can
be made to promote recycling and efficient use of clay resources.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: The clay industry has a significant economic impact, supporting
clay miners, manufacturers, artisans, and the construction and ceramics industries.
It contributes to local and global economies through job creation, trade, and the
supply of essential raw materials.
