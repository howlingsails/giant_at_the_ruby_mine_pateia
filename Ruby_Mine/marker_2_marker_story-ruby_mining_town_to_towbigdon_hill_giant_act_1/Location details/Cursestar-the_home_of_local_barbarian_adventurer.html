         Source and Habitat: Wheat is a cereal grain that is widely cultivated and consumed
worldwide. It is primarily grown in regions with temperate climates. Common
varieties of wheat include hard wheat, soft wheat, durum wheat, and spelt.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Wheat is cultivated by sowing wheat seeds in prepared
fields. The plants require well-drained soil, moderate temperatures, and appropriate
moisture levels for optimal growth. Wheat plants go through stages of germination,
vegetative growth, flowering, and grain formation.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: Wheat is harvested when the grains have reached maturity and
dried on the stalks. The timing of harvest is crucial to ensure proper grain quality
and minimize losses. Modern combine harvesters are commonly used to efficiently
harvest and separate the grain from the stalks.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, wheat grains go through processing steps to remove the
outer husk and separate the bran and germ from the endosperm. The endosperm is then
ground into flour, which can be further processed to produce different wheat-based
products.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Wheat grains are stored in dry, well-ventilated facilities
to prevent moisture absorption and insect infestation. Flour and wheat-based
products should be stored in airtight containers to maintain their freshness and
prevent spoilage.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">

is commonly milled into flour and used for baking bread, pastries, cakes, and other
baked goods. Wheat is also used to make pasta, couscous, breakfast cereals, and
other wheat-based products.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Sustainable wheat cultivation involves implementing environmentally
friendly practices, such as crop rotation, soil conservation, water management, and
responsible pesticide use. Sustainable farming methods aim to reduce the
environmental impact and promote long-term productivity.
        </div>

worldwide and are typically kept in farm settings during the 16th century.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Cattle are bred and raised by humans through selective
breeding. In the 16th century, sustainable cattle farming involved traditional
methods such as allowing them to graze in pastures and rotating their grazing areas.
The cattle were left to forage naturally, minimizing the use of external resources.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: For meat production, cattle were harvested when they reached
the desired age and weight. In the 16th century, manual methods were used for
slaughter and butchering, ensuring minimal waste and utilizing various cuts of meat.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: In the 16th century, processing cattle involved traditional techniques
like salting, smoking, and drying the meat to preserve it for longer periods. Milk
