        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Source and Habitat: Cobalt is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal found in different
minerals in the Earth's crust. It's often associated with copper and nickel ores.
It's typically found in areas with high geological activity.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Cobalt is extracted through sophisticated mining techniques.
Given our fantasy setting, perhaps mythical creatures with an affinity for the earth
assist in these mining operations.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: After mining, cobalt ores are collected and sent for further
processing. These ores are crushed and ground to liberate the cobalt minerals.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: The cobalt minerals undergo flotation to produce a cobalt-rich
concentrate, which is then smelted at high temperature to produce cobalt metal. Our
fantasy world could have specialized fire or earth elementals aiding in this
process.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Cobalt is usually stored in the form of ingots. It doesn't
require any special storage conditions but should be kept dry to prevent oxidation.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Transportation: Cobalt is typically transported in its ingot form, often using carts
or wagons for land-based travel. For longer distances, ships may be used.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Distribution: Cobalt is sold to blacksmiths, alchemists, and magical practitioners,

high-performance alloys. It's also valued for its deep blue color, which is used in
jewelry and decoration.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Cobalt is a non-renewable resource. Its mining must be managed
responsibly to avoid over-extraction and to minimize environmental impact.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: Cobalt is a valuable resource, and its extraction, processing, and
sale contribute significantly to the economy. It can generate wealth and provide
jobs across a range of industries, from mining to magic.

beans.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, cocoa beans undergo a multi-step process. They are
fermented to develop flavor, dried to reduce moisture content, and then roasted to
bring out the characteristic cocoa aroma. The roasted beans are cracked and winnowed
to remove the outer shell, resulting in cocoa nibs.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Storage and Preservation: Cocoa beans or cocoa nibs should be stored in a cool, dry

products. It serves as a key ingredient in confectionery, baking, desserts, and
beverages. Cocoa powder and cocoa butter are also utilized in various culinary
applications.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: Sustainable cocoa cultivation involves implementing practices that
promote environmental stewardship, fair labor conditions, and the economic well-
being of cocoa farmers. Efforts are made to protect biodiversity, conserve natural
resources, and support local communities.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Economic Impact: Cocoa production and trade have a significant economic impact,
especially in countries that are major cocoa producers. It provides income for
farmers, employment opportunities in processing and distribution, and contributes to
national and international chocolate markets.

hand-picked or harvested using machinery, ensuring that they are not damaged during
the process.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, tobacco leaves undergo a series of processing steps.
These may include drying, fermenting, curing, aging, and blending, depending on the
desired tobacco product. The processing methods greatly impact the flavor, aroma,

        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Cultivation/Extraction: Goats are bred and raised by humans through selective
breeding. In sustainable goat farming during the 16th century, suitable housing and
grazing areas were provided for goats to exhibit their natural foraging behavior.
Goats would roam freely, browsing on a variety of vegetation, thus reducing the need
for external feed sources.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: For milk production, goats were regularly hand-milked using
traditional methods. In the case of meat production, goats were harvested when they
reached the desired age and weight, ensuring optimal quality for consumption.
