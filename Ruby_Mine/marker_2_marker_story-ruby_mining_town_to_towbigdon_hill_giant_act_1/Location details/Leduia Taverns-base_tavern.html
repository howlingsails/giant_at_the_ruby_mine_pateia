        description: The tavern has a cozy and intimate atmosphere, with a mixture of wooden
tables and chairs made of maple wood. The walls are decorated with tapestries
depicting mythical creatures and the floor is covered in a thick layer of straw. The
centerpiece of the room is a large stone fireplace made of light grey limestone,
which provides warmth and comfort to the patrons. The soft glow of candlelight and
the warmth of the fire make this a perfect spot for romantic dinners and intimate
conversations.

            rules: Dice Forge: The Battle of Numbers is a game of strategy and luck played with
ten d6 dice. Each player takes on the role of a powerful sorcerer racing to harness
the power of a mystical forge. On their turn, a player rolls all ten dice and tries
to get as many of them to show the same number as possible. They can keep any dice
that match and re-roll the rest, trying to build a set of ten matching dice as
quickly as possible. Once a player has ten matching dice, the game ends and points
are tallied.
           </div>
           <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
            goal: The goal of Dice Forge: The Battle of Numbers is to be the player with the
most points at the end of the game, which is triggered when a player manages to
build a set of ten matching dice. Players earn points based on the total value of
their dice, but only the matches count towards the loser's score. Players must use
strategy and luck to build their set of matching dice as quickly as possible while
also trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.
