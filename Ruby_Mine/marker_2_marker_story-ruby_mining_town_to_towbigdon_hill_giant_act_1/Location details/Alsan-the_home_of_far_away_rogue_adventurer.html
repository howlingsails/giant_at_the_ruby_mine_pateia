town clean. These pigs roam around the streets and alleys, scavenging for food
waste.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Harvesting/Collection: For pork production, pigs are harvested when they reach the

their pigs together and take them to a designated area where they would be
slaughtered using traditional methods.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Processing: After harvesting, the carcasses of pigs are processed into various cuts

         Distribution: Pork products are distributed within the town or nearby communities.
People can purchase them from local butchers or marketplaces. The distribution is
mainly done within a limited geographical area due to transportation limitations
during the 16th century.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Usage: Pork is a versatile meat used in various dishes prepared by the townspeople.
It can be cooked in different ways, such as grilling, roasting, frying, or stewing.
The people of the 16th century use pork to create dishes like sausages, bacon, ham,
and various pork-based recipes.
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
         Sustainability: During the 16th century, the presence of pigs in towns helped
maintain cleanliness by consuming food scraps and waste. This practice had
sustainability benefits, as it reduced the amount of organic waste that could
otherwise contribute to pollution or attract vermin.
        </div>
