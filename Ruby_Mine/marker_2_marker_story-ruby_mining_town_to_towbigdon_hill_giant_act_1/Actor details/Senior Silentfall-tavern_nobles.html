            You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special
ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour,
which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it
into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon
thereafter. You can&rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The
weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on
a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The
weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond
breaks.

power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who
serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with
the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity
allows you to understand and cast.

creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written
in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To
all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical
script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to
be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though
the language must be one you know.  Should the spell be dispelled, the original
script and the illusion both disappear.  A creature with truesight can read the
hidden message.

         description: You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this
spell again.  If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a
scream. It can be your voice, someone else&rsquo;s voice, a lion&rsquo;s roar, a beating of
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the
duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
If you create an image of an object&mdash;such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small
chest&mdash;it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&rsquo;t create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.  If a creature uses its
action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an
illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell
save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes
faint to the creature.

practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:  * You
create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff
of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.  * You instantaneously light or snuff
out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.  * You instantaneously clean or soil an
object no larger than 1 cubic foot.  * You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot
of nonliving material for 1 hour.  * You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol
appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.  * You create a nonmagical trinket or
an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your
next turn.  If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an
action.

         description: This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that
performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into
existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit
point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the
spell ends.  Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command
the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can
perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things,
cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.
Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability
until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.  If you command the
servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the
spell ends.
