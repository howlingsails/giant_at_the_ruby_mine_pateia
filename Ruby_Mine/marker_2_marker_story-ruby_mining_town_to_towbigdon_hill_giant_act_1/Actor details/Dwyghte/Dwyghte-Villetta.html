                Grimegmea. With blue eyes and luminous, bleached hair, Dwyghte possesses a distinct appearance. They
                have a thick and hazelnut-colored skin, showcasing the ruggedness of a life spent in nature. Dwyghte's
                doe-shaped eyes and broad forehead add to their unique facial features, along with a Roman nose and a
                full mouth. Their thick eyebrows complement their weather-beaten aging skin, while their body is bald.

                Behaviorally, Dwyghte is known for quoting sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation,

                curiosity and a love for mysteries, always seeking to uncover hidden truths. Dwyghte has a penchant for

                Dwyghte Elfblade is a chaotic neutral druid, embodying the ideals of change and embracing the
                transformative power of the gods. They hold a deep-seated desire for revenge against the corrupt temple
                hierarchy who branded them a heretic, suggesting a strong sense of justice and a commitment to righting
                wrongs. While they judge others harshly, including themselves, their self-reflection demonstrates a

                reckoned with in both combat and spiritual matters.
