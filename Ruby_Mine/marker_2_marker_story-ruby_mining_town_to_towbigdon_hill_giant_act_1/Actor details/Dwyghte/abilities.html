            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                As a druid with a quarterstaff and a light hammer, you have several options for attacking the owlbear in
                D&D. Here are a few attack scenarios:

            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">

                Scenario 1:
                You decide to use your quarterstaff against the owlbear. You roll a d20 to hit, adding your attack
                bonus.

                Roll to Hit:
                d20 + Attack Bonus

                If you successfully hit, you roll damage with your quarterstaff.

                Roll for Damage:
                1d8 + Strength Modifier

                The owlbear's reaction will depend on the amount of damage dealt. It may retaliate or take defensive
                actions, such as attacking you or attempting to dodge your next attack.


            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Scenario 2:
                In another instance, you opt to use your light hammer against the owlbear. Again, you roll a d20 to hit,
                adding your attack bonus.

                Roll to Hit:
                d20 + Attack Bonus

                If your attack hits, you roll damage with your light hammer.

                Roll for Damage:
                1d4 + Strength Modifier

                The owlbear's reaction will vary based on the amount of damage inflicted. It might become more
                aggressive or attempt to retreat.

                Remember, the specific attack bonus and strength modifier values will depend on your character's
                abilities and proficiency. Additionally, the owlbear's armor class and hit points will affect your
                chances of hitting and the amount of damage you can deal.

        <div class="burgSummary">
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">

                In this scenario, let's assume the druid and their bard parents are in a pool without any armor or
                weapons, with rocks and their spellcasting abilities available. Here are four tactics they might employ
                against the owlbear:
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">

                Tactic 1: Distraction and Rock Throw
                The bard parents decide to use their spells to create distracting illusions, while the druid picks up
                rocks from the poolside and throws them at the owlbear.
                <br>
                Bard Action:
                <br>
                Parent 1 casts Minor Illusion to create the sound of a loud predator nearby, distracting the owlbear.
                <br>
                Parent 2 casts Prestidigitation to create flashing lights in the owlbear's peripheral vision, further
                disorienting it.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid picks up rocks and throws them at the owlbear to keep it off balance.
                <br>
                Roll to Hit with Rock:
                <br>
                d20 + Dexterity Modifier
                <br>
                If the rock hits, roll for improvised weapon damage.
                <br>
                Roll for Damage with Rock:
                <br>
                1d4 + Strength Modifier
                <br>
                The DM might roll for the owlbear's reaction, possibly taking damage or becoming momentarily distracted
                by the illusions and rock throws.
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Tactic 2: Enchantment and Push
                <br>
                The bard parents use enchantment spells to try and affect the owlbear's mind, while the druid attempts
                to push it back into the pool.
                <br>
                Bard Action:
                <br>
                Parent 1 casts Charm Person on the owlbear, attempting to make it friendly or less hostile.
                <br>
                Parent 2 casts Friends to try and influence the owlbear's attitude towards them.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid moves behind the owlbear and attempts to push it back into the pool.
                <br>
                Roll to Push the Owlbear:
                <br>
                Strength (Athletics) Check (opposed by the owlbear's Strength or Dexterity check)
                <br>
                The DM determines the owlbear's reaction to the enchantment spells and the druid's attempt to push it.

            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Tactic 3: Spellcasting and Evasion (Updated)
                The bard parents use their spellcasting abilities to hinder the owlbear's movements, while the druid
                focuses on evasion and keeping a safe distance.

                Bard Action:
                <br>
                Parent 1 casts Bane on the owlbear, attempting to weaken its attacks and saving throws by imposing a
                penalty on them.
                <br>
                Parent 2 casts Vicious Mockery, insulting and distracting the owlbear to impose disadvantage on its next
                attack roll.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid uses their mobility and nature-based spells to stay agile and keep a safe distance from the
                owlbear.
                <br>

                The DM rolls for the owlbear's saving throw against Bane and determines its reaction to the insults and
                distractions caused by Vicious Mockery. The owlbear's attack rolls may be made with disadvantage due to
                Vicious Mockery.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">

                Tactic 4: Healing and Support
                <br>
                The bard parents focus on healing and providing support to the druid, boosting their abilities and
                helping them endure the owlbear's attacks.
                <br>
                Bard Action:
                <br>
                Parent 1 casts Healing Word to restore the druid's hit points.
                <br>
                Parent 2 uses the Help action, giving the druid advantage on their next attack roll against the owlbear.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid takes advantage of the support received and attacks the owlbear using their natural abilities
                or available spells.
                <br>
                The DM determines the effectiveness of the healing spell and the druid's attack roll against the
                owlbear, considering the advantage granted by the Help action.
                <br>
                Remember, the specific rolls and outcomes will depend on the characters' abilities, the owlbear's
                statistics, and the DM's discretion in the game.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Action 5: Animal Friendship
                The druid attempts to use their spellcasting ability to befriend the owlbear and convince it to become
                non-hostile.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid casts Animal Friendship, trying to magically convince the owlbear that they mean no harm and
                should be trusted.
                <br>
                Roll for Spell Save DC:
                <br>
                The owlbear must make a Wisdom saving throw against the druid's spell save DC.
                <br>
                The DM determines the owlbear's reaction based on the outcome of the saving throw and the druid's
                spellcasting ability.

            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Action 6: Calming Tones and Retreat
                The bard parents use their calming voices and soothing melodies to try to pacify the owlbear, while the
                druid takes the opportunity to retreat.
                <br>

                Bard Action:
                <br>
                Parent 1 uses their Bardic Inspiration ability to inspire the owlbear with calming tones and melodies,
                attempting to soothe its aggression.
                <br>
                Parent 2 casts Dissonant Whispers at a low level, aiming to create a jarring sound that may cause the
                owlbear to flee.
                <br>
                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid takes the opportunity while the bard parents are calming the owlbear to slowly and stealthily
                retreat from the area.
                <br>
                The DM determines the owlbear's response to the calming tones and dissonant whispers. The success of the
                retreat depends on the druid's ability to move silently and the owlbear's perception.

            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Action 7: Offer Food and Peaceful Gestures
                <br>
                The druid and bard parents attempt to establish peace by offering the owlbear food and making peaceful
                gestures.
                <br>

                Druid and Bard Actions:
                <br>
                The druid and bard parents gather fruits or other food items and slowly approach the owlbear, making
                gentle, non-threatening gestures. They offer the food to the owlbear, showing their peaceful intentions.
                <br>

                The DM determines the owlbear's reaction based on its level of hostility, hunger, and the characters'
                approach.

            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Action 8: Hide and Camouflage
                The druid uses their druidcraft ability to create natural camouflage for themselves and the bard
                parents, allowing them to hide and escape the owlbear's notice.
                <br>

                Druid Action:
                <br>
                The druid uses druidcraft to create natural illusions, such as falling leaves or the sound of animals,
                to distract and confuse the owlbear's senses. They find suitable cover or foliage to hide themselves and
                the bard parents, blending in with their surroundings.
                <br>

                The DM determines the owlbear's perception checks to detect the characters' hiding and camouflage
                attempts. The success of the escape relies on the owlbear's perception and the characters' ability to
                remain hidden.
                <br>

                Remember, these actions and their outcomes are subject to the rules of the game, the characters'
                abilities, the owlbear's behavior, and the DM's decisions in the specific campaign.

                remains restrained for now.

                <strong>Description:</strong> You create a magical light within a 20-foot cube. Any creature within
                the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in light. The outlined creatures
                shed dim light, cannot benefit from invisibility, and attackers have advantage on attack rolls
                against them.

                <strong>Example:</strong> Sensing the owlbear's stealthy movements in the dense forest, you raise
                your hands and summon the essence of faerie light. The owlbear, previously hidden in the shadows, is
                now bathed in a soft glow, its outline clearly visible. Your allies take advantage of the newfound
                visibility and launch a coordinated attack against the owlbear, their strikes finding their mark
                more easily.

                creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the
                creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Feeling the owlbear closing in, you take a deep breath and release a
                primal roar. A shockwave of thunder erupts from your position, shaking the ground and deafening
                those nearby. The owlbear is caught in the blast, thrown backward by the force and momentarily
                stunned, giving your allies a precious moment to reposition and strike.

                it to wince in agony and fear. It breaks away from you, frantically retreating, unable to bear the

                <strong>Example:</strong> As you grip your quarterstaff, you mutter ancient words and trace symbols
