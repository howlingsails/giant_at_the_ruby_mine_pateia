           Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
your turn ends and you haven&rsquo;t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or
taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack
rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage

          <div class="story-block">
           You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such

again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

          content: For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end&mdash; that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you
enter the berserker&rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own
health or well-being.
         </div>
         <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
          Frenzy: Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy
when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single
melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When
your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).
         </div>
         <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
          Mindless Rage: Beginning at 6th level, you can&rsquo;t be charmed or frightened while
raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration of the rage.

            Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your
menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use
your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until
the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of
line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
           </div>
           <div class="story-block">
            If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on that
creature again for 24 hours.

          Retaliation: Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack
against that creature.
