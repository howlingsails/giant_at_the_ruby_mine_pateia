          content: For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end&mdash; that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you
enter the berserker&rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own
health or well-being.

          Frenzy: Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy
when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single
melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When
your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use
your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until
the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of
line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
