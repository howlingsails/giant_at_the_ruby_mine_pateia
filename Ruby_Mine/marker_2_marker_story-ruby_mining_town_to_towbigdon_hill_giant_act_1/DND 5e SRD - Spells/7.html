flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal
to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  If the glowing bead is
touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the
bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to
40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead
explodes.  The fire damages objects in the area dn ignites flammable objects that
aren't being worn or carried.

       description: You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area
where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the
duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you
can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an
extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there
looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.  While on the
Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that
plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't
interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to
do so.  You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane,
allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.
When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plan you originated from in the
spot you currently occupy.  If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or
creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied
space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet
you are moved.  This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the
Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

       description: An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a
cage or a solid box, as you choose.  A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20
feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2-inch apart.  A
prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a size, creating a solid
barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells
cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is
completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the
area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of
the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage
can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or
interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On
a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the
creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.  This spell can't be
dispelled by _[dispel magic](../dispel-magic/ "dispel magic (lvl 3)")_.

       description: You make terrain in a area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the
same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill,
crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem
like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gental slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a
wide and smooth road.  Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, and
add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal or add
creatures.  The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,
so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise
impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock
or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.  Creatures
with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all
other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the
illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the
palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near
that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you
might arrive in is Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city
from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the
sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell
can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all
the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to
the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another
plane.  Chose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it.
On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this
save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.
A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of
existence.

different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot
code must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine
which color ray affects it.  1-Red: The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  2-Orange: The target takes 10d6
acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  3-Yellow:
The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.  4-Green: The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.  5-Blue: The target takes 10d6 cold damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  6-Indigo: On a failed
save, the target is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If
it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep
track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  7-Violet: On a failed
save, the target is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of
your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the
creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no
longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane
is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal
planes.)  8-Special: The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling
any 8.

The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before,
regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is
intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it
gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms
perfectly.  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in
its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to
using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and
deafened in regard to your own surroundings.  Physical interaction with the image
reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that
uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

       description: This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder
centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow
anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when
you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a
fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.  If some solid object (such as a
ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creature strike it just as
they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top
of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for
the duration.  At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back
down.

       description: By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the
target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived
through scrying sensors created by divination spells.  If the target is a creature,
it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it
doesn't grow older.  You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The
condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile
of the target.  Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque
awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

       description: You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within
range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature,
partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be
affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has
half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment.
Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.  The
simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken
commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn
in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it
never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell
slots.  If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory,
using rare herbs and minerals worth 100gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum
lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts
instantly.  If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you
created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

       description: When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a
surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that
can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than
10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place;
if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph
is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.  The glyph is nearly
invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to find it.  You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For
glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a
certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs
inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object,
approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.  You
can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain
circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or
shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as
those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the
options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-
radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature in the sphere when the glyph activate is targeted by its effect, as is a
creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
Death: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.  Discord: Each
target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and
argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of
meaningful Communication and has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.
Fear: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Frightened for 1
minute on a failed save. While Frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding
and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
Hopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the
target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't Attack
or target any creature with harmful Abilities, Spells, or other magical Effects.
Insanity: Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take Actions, can't
understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The
DM controls its Movement, which is erratic.  Pain: Each target must make a
Constitution saving throw and becomes Incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1
minute on a failed save.  Sleep: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and
falls Unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes
damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.  Stunning: Each
target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Stunned for 1 minute on a failed
save.

       description: This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object, that you can see
within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able
to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an
unwilling creature.  The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be
on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the
table.  | Familiarity       | Mishap | Simliar Area | Off Target | On Target |

False destination | 01-50  |    51-100    |     ---    |    ---    |  Familiarity:
"Permanent Circle" means a permanent Teleportation Circle whose sigil sequence you
know. "Associated Object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired
destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's Library, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a Lich's Secret tomb. "Very
familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied,
or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you
have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a
place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose
location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a
map. "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an
enemy's sanctum but instead view an illusion, or you were attempting to teleport to
a familiar location that no longer exists.  On Target: You and your group (or the
target object) appear where you want to go.  Off Target: You and your group (or the
target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be
travelled. For example, if you tried to Travel 120 miles, landed off target, and
rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18
miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and
designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of
the compass. If you were teleporting to a Coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at
sea, you could be in trouble.  Similar Area: You and your group (or the target
object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the
target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might
wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many
of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the
closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably
wind up anywhere on the plane.  Mishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force
damage and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple Mishaps
can occur, dealing damage each time).

       description: A whirlwind howls down to a point on the ground you specify. The
whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until
the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any
direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects
that aren&rsquo;t secured to anything and that aren&rsquo;t worn or carried by anyone.  A
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters
the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind
first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails
the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the
whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the
whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at
the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell
ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.  A restrained creature can
use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If
successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6
&times; 10 feet away from it in a random direction.
