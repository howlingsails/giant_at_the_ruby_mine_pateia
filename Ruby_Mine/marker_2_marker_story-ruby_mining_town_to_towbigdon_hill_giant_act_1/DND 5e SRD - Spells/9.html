       description: You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral
bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are
already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a
state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.  Your
astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game
statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery
cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to
invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long
as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut--
something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.  Your astral form can freely
travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when
casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord,
allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a
separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on
your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.  The spell ends for
you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.  The spell might
also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful _dispel magic_ spell
used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a
creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends
for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended
animation.  If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in
their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by
dropping to 0 hit points.

range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a
circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the
portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.  The portal
has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is
possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly
transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the
portal.  Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell
from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.  When you cast this
spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title or nickname
doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the
portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature
through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no
special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate.
It might leave, attack you or help you.

       description: You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see
within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the
spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While
affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it
doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.  When you cast
the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.  Burial: The
target is entombed far beneath the earth in a Sphere of magical force that is just
large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the Sphere, nor can any
creature Teleport or use Planar Travel to get into or out of it. The special
component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.  Chaining: Heavy
chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is
Restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until
then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of
precious metal.  Hedged Prison: The spell transports the target into a tiny
Demiplane that is warded against teleportation and Planar Travel. The Demiplane can
be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your
choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature
representation of the prison made from jade.  Minimus Containment: The target
shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object.
Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and
other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of
teleportation or Planar Travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell
remains in Effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large,
transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.  Slumber: The target
falls asleep and can't be awoken. The Special component for this version of the
spell consists of rare soporific herbs.  Ending the Spell: During the casting of the
spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell
to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as
you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a
likelihood of coming to pass. The Conditions can be based on a creature's name,
identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable Actions or qualities
and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or Hit Points.  A _dispel magic_
spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either
the prison or the special component used to create it.  You can use a particular
special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again
using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from
its binding.

       description: A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall
--up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick--centered on a point you can
see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet
in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place
for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space
occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are
wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an
additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell
can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can
see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The
wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts
to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all
thew wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must
make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described
below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to
violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so
for the Duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but
an Antimagic Field has no Effect on it.  Red: The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in
place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be
destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.  Orange: The creature takes 10d6
acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this
layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is
destroyed by a Strong Wind.  Yellow: The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed
by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.  Green: The creature takes 10d6 poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall
spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid
surface, destroys this layer.  Blue: The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by
dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.  Indigo: On a failed save, the creature is
Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save
three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified
condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of
both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place,
Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed
by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.  Violet: On a
failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the
start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that
save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no
longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane
is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal
planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or a similar spell of equal
or higher level that can end Spells and magical Effects.

       description: You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new
form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower.
The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of
creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one
without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.  Your game statistics are
replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignement
and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and
saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is
higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any
legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.  You assume the hit points and
Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of
dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As
long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you
aren't knocked unconscious.  You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically
capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example,
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the
creature can normally speak.  When you transform, you choose whether your equipment
falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to
wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment
doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new
form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.
Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.  During this spell's Duration,
you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions
and rules for the original form, with one exception - if your new form has more hit
pints than your current one, your Hit Points remain at their current value.

spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and
strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath
the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.  Each round
you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on
your turn.  Round 2: Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object
under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.  Round 3: You call six bolts of lightning
from the cloud to strike six creatures or Objects of your choice beneath the cloud.
A given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature
must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Round 4: Hailstones rain
down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
Round 5-10: Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. the area
becomes Difficult Terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6
cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain
count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining Concentration on
Spells. Finally, gusts of Strong Wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour)
automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area whether mundane
or magical.

it transformed. If it reverts as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce
the creature's normal form to 0 Hit Points, it isn't knocked Unconscious. The
creature is limited in the Actions it can perform by the Nature of its new form, and
it can't speak, cast Spells, or take any other action that requires hands or Speech
unless its new form is capable of such Actions. The target's gear melds into the new
form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its
Equipment.  Object into Creature: You can turn an object into any kind of creature,
as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the
creature's Challenge Rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your
companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how
it moves. The DM has the creature's Statistics and resolves all of its Actions and
Movement. If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It
might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.  Creature into
Object: If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it
is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature's Statistics become those of
the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the
spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

       description: _Wish_ is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply
speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your
desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level
or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly
components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the
following effects of your choice:  * You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in
value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any
dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.  * You
allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end
all effects on them described in the _greater restoration_ spell.  * You grant up to
ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.  * You grant
up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect
for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to
a lich's life drain attack.  * You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of
any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes
itself to accomodate the new result. For example, a _wish_ spell could undo an
opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can
force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.  You might be able to achieve
something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as
precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an
instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly
achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you
forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively
removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or
artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating
another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell
until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell.
This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, you Strength
drops to 3 if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that
you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining
recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you
are unable to cast _wish_ ever again if you suffer this stress.
