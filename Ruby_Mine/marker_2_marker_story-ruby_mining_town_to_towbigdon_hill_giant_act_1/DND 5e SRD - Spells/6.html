       description: You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the
duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet
of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter,
opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature,
the spell fails, and the casting is lost.  The portals are two-dimensional glowing
rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at
the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is
the side that functions as a portal.  Any creature or object entering the portal
exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing
through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each
portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the
rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.

       description: You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground
that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5
feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide
enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature
is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit
points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain
with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.  If a pillar is created under
a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by
the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.  If a pillar is prevented from
reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the
pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar
and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or
Dexterity check (the creature&rsquo;s choice) against the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC. On a
success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or
fall off it.

       description: You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of
Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your
control. (The DM has game statistics for these creatures.)  As a bonus action on
each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this
spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures,
you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move
during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends
itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24
hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain
control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the
creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts
your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather
than animating new ones.

throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.  A disintegrated creature
and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile

Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is
a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-
cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the

area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area
by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the *[plane
shift](../plane-shift/ "plane shift (lvl 7)")* spell.  In addition, the spell
damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of
the following - Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a chosen
creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast
this spell).  When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature
that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.  The
spell's area can't overlap with the area of another *forbiddance* spell. If you cast
*forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it
is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

       description: You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space
(an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot
squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You
can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as
you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  When you
cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of
the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken
aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.  *Guards and wards* creates the
following effects within the warded area.  Corridors: Fog fills all the warded
corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or
branching Passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that
a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
the one it chooses.  Doors: All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if
sealed by an Arcane Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an
Illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the Minor Illusion spell) to
make them appear as plain sections of wall.  Stairs: Webs fill all Stairs in the
warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes
if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.  Other Spell Effect:
You can place your choice of one of the following magical Effects within the warded
area of the stronghold. * Place *[dancing lights](../dancing-lights/ "dancing lights
(cantrip)")* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights
repeat as long as guards and wards lasts. * Place *[magic mouth](../magic-mouth/
"magic mouth (lvl 2)")* in two locations. * Place *[stinking cloud](../stinking-
cloud/ "stinking cloud (lvl 3)")* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places
you designate; They return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and
wards* lasts. * Place a constant *[gust of wind](../gust-of-wind/ "gust of wind (lvl
2)")* in one corridor or room. * Place a *[suggestion](../suggestion/ "suggestion
(lvl 2)")* in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any
creature that enters or passes through the area recieves the suggestion mentally.
The whole warded area radiates magic. A *[dispel magic](../dispel-magic/ "dispel
magic (lvl 3)")* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell
there every day for one year.

terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.  * You can use your
action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched
hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution
saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has
its speed halved until the start of your next turn.

inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the

to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your
living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid's body.  You
can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see
(creatures warded by a *[protection from evil and good](../protection-from-evil-and-
good "protection from evil and good (lvl 1)")* or *[magic circle](../magic-circle

soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts
to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you
possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the
statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If
the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its

can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within
100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body
dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if
it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or
the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more
than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to
it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed,
the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet.
Otherwise, that creature dies.  When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

       description: You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to
you - a god, a Primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That
entity sends a Celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making
the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific
creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that
creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).  When the
creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can
ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&rsquo;t obliged
to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or
help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our
foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.  Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might
require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend
might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange
their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be
measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in
hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days)
requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the
circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the
creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks
typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks
might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service
expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if
appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for
the creature&rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.  A
creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full

       description: You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible
phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The
illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and
you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it
makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.  When the condition you
specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you
described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant
for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. The triggering
condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on
visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you
could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to
open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature
says the correct word or phrase.  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action
to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and
any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

       description: You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with
needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for
the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5
feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5
feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.  When the wall appears, each creature
within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.  A creature
can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature
moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first
time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must
make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.

       description: You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud
form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from
nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash
action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time
a creature is incapacitated and can&rsquo;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can
revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.  If a
creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60
feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can&rsquo;t land
after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
