       description: Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing
creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of
a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rationg of 4 or lower.  On subsequent
turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.  The
transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to
0 hit points or dies.  You can choose a different form for each target. A target's
game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, thought the
target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal
form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal
form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the
actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast
spells.  The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate,
wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

       description: A 10-foot-radius Invisible Sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area
is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the Sphere,
Spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even Magic Items become
mundane. Until the spell ends, the Sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells
and other magical Effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are
suppressed in the Sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a
suppressed spell is consumed. While an Effect is suppressed, it doesn't function,
but the time it spends suppressed counts against its Duration.  * Targeted Effects:
Spells and other magical Effects, such as Magic Missile and Charm Person, that
target a creature or an object in the Sphere have no Effect on that target. * Areas
of Magic: The area of another spell or magical Effect, such as Fireball, can't
extend into the Sphere. If the Sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the
area that is covered by the Sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by
a Wall of Fire are suppressed within the Sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the
overlap is large enough. * Spells: Any active spell or other magical Effect on a
creature or an object in the Sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in
it. * Magic Items: The Properties and powers of Magic Items are suppressed in the
Sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical long
sword. A magic weapon's Properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a
target in the Sphere or wielded by an attacker in the Sphere. If a Magic Weapon or
piece of magic Ammunition fully leaves the Sphere (For example, if you fire a Magic
Arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item
ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. * Magical Travel: Teleportation and
Planar Travel fail to work in the Sphere, whether the Sphere is the destination or
the departure point for such magical Travel. A portal to another location, world, or
plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that
created by the Rope Trick Spells, temporarily closes while in the Sphere. *
Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily
winks out of existence in the Sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the
space the creature occupied is no longer within the Sphere. * Dispel Magic: Spells
and magical Effects such as Dispel Magic have no Effect on the Sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field Spells don't nullify each other.

       description: This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that
is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such
as Red Dragons, Goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either
attracts or repels the specified creatures for the Duration. Choose antipathy or
sympathy as the aura's Effect.  * Antipathy. The Enchantment causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target.
When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened. The creature remains
frigh&NoBreak;tened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While
frig&NoBreak;htened by the target, the creature must use its Movement to move to the nearest
safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60
feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer fright&NoBreak;ened, but
the creature becomes fright&NoBreak;ened again if it regains sight of the target or moves
within 60 feet of it.  * Sympathy. The Enchantment causes the specified creatures to
feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to
see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the
creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its Movement on each of its
turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has
done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or
otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw to end the Effect, as described below.  * Ending the Effect. If an affected
creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the
creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. ON a successful save, the creature is no
longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction
as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the Spells is allowed another Wisdom
saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.  A creature that successfully
saves against this Effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.

       description: You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see
within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through
unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty
room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door
disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there,
as the door also disappears from the other side.  Each time you cast this spell, you
can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you
created with a previous casting of this spell.  Additionally, if you know the nature
and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature,
you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

       description: You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you
or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the
saving throw.  While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as
long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this
telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action
required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general
course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that
object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction
from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.  You can use
your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your
next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything
that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to
use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.  Each time
the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If
the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

       description: You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can
see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a
100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in
contact with the ground in that area.  The ground in the area becomes difficult
terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.  When you
cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each
creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is knocked prone.  This spell can have additional effects
depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.  Fissures. Fissures
open throughout the spell&rsquo;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the
spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10
x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell&rsquo;s area to the
opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the
fissure&rsquo;s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).  Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning
damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the
spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure
drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A
creature within half the distance of a structure&rsquo;s height must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is
knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on
the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and doesn&rsquo;t fall prone or become buried.
