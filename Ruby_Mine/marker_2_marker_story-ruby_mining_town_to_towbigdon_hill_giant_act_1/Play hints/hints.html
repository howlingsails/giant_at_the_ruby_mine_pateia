       In a magical fantasy world, miners, smelters, and smiths typically operate in a
similar manner to their counterparts in the real world. The process of getting ore
to finished products typically begins with miners extracting ore from the ground.
The ore is then taken to a smelter, where it is heated and melted down to separate
the metal from the other minerals. The metal is then taken to a smith, who uses a
variety of tools and techniques to shape the metal into the desired product. The
skills and equipment needed for this process vary depending on the type of ore being
mined and the type of product being made. Miners typically need pickaxes, shovels,
and other tools for extracting ore from the ground. Smelters typically need
furnaces, crucibles, and other tools for melting down the ore. Smiths typically need
anvils, hammers, tongs, and other tools for shaping the metal into the desired
product. Additionally, magical items such as enchanted pickaxes, hammers, and tongs
may be used to speed up the process and make it easier for miners, smelters, and
smiths to do their jobs.

       In Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition, grappling is a type of special attack that allows
a creature to physically restrain another creature. To grapple a creature, the
attacker must make an unarmed strike or grapple check against the target. If
successful, the target is grappled and the attacker can choose to either maintain
the grapple or release the target. While grappled, the target has disadvantage on
attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and cannot move away from the grappler.
