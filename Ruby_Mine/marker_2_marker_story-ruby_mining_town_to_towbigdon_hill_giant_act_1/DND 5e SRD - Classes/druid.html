           Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain
your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also
retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining
those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus
in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours.
If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&rsquo;t use them.

          <div class="story-block speakingToMeNow">
           When you transform, you assume the beast&rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert
to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you
transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any
excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage
in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long
as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t
knocked unconscious.

          <div class="story-block speakingToMeNow">
           You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires
hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break
your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from
taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you&rsquo;ve
already cast.

           You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and
can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t
use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has
that sense.

           You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into
your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM
decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based
on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to
match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall
to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect
until you leave the form.

       Beast Spells: Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components
of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren&rsquo;t able to provide material
components.

You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild
Shape.

        content: The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within
sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The
circle&rsquo;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the
Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this
circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the
circle&rsquo;s mysterious rites.

          Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in
meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell
slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less
than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or
higher. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

          For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth
of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

         A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder,
hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such
plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
sprigs of mistletoe.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and
shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars
or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with
strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or
quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be
used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to
take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca
tree and cactus plants.

       Druids and the Gods: Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most
druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse
(the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these
deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and
urbanized peoples.
