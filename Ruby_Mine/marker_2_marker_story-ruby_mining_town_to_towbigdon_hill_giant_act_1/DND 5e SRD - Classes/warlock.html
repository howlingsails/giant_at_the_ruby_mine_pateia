transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2
hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

          Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When
you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the
roll&rsquo;s effects occur.

        Fiendish Resilience: Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you
finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you
choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver
weapons ignores this resistance.

         ***Pact of the Chain.*** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its
default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied
to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One&rsquo;s
nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         ***Pact of the Blade.*** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a
slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be
an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the
Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone
embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         ***Pact of the Tome.*** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with
spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be
a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration
and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of
the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with
the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity
allows you to understand and cast.
