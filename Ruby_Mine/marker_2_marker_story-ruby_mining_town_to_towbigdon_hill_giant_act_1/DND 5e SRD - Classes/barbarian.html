bonus action.

         While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor:

         <div class="story-block speakingToMeNow">
          When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage
roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
column of the Barbarian table.
         </div>

         If you are able to cast spells, you can&rsquo;t cast them or concentrate on them while
raging.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
your turn ends and you haven&rsquo;t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or
taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages
column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage
again.

      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 +
your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still
gain this benefit.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Reckless Attack: Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense
to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you
can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack
rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage
until your next turn.

         At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren&rsquo;t as they should
be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such
as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can&rsquo;t be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.

      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Primal Path: At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.
Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at
the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and
again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Ability Score Improvement: When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an
ability score above 20 using this feature.

       Extra Attack: Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

rolls.

         Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren&rsquo;t
incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your
rage before doing anything else on that turn.

         This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at

         Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If
you drop to 0 hit points while you&rsquo;re raging and don&rsquo;t die outright, you can make a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
        </div>

      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Indomitable Might: Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is

        content: For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end&mdash; that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you
enter the berserker&rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own
health or well-being.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Frenzy: Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy
when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single
melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When
your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Mindless Rage: Beginning at 6th level, you can&rsquo;t be charmed or frightened while

          Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your
menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use
your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until
the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of
line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
