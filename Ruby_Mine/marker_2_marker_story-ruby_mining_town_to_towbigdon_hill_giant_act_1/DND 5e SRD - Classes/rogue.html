         **Expertise**
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill
proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves&rsquo; tools. Your proficiency bonus is
doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with
thieves&rsquo; tools) to gain this benefit.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         **Sneak Attack**
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe&rsquo;s
distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit
with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a
finesse or a ranged weapon.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         You don&rsquo;t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within
5 feet of it, that enemy isn&rsquo;t incapacitated, and you don&rsquo;t have disadvantage on the
attack roll.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown
in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

        <div class="story-block">
         During your rogue training you learned thieves&rsquo; cant, a secret mix of dialect,
jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation.
Only another creature that knows thieves&rsquo; cant understands such messages. It takes
four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea
plainly.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short,
simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&rsquo;
guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or
will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
        </div>
       </div>
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Cunning Action: Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to
move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat.
This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Roguish Archetype: At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the
exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed
at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at
3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Ability Score Improvement: When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Uncanny Dodge: Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you
with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack&rsquo;s damage against you.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Evasion: Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area
effects, such as a red dragon&rsquo;s fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are
subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
half damage if you fail.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Reliable Talent: By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they
approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Blindsense: Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the
location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Slippery Mind: By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
      </div>
      <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
       Elusive: Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the
upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren&rsquo;t
incapacitated.
      </div>

        <div class="story-block">
         At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your
attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit.
Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long

       content: Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting
their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly
quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions,
embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your
focus&mdash;not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of
your preferred techniques.

        content: You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses,
and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to
think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and
investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills
useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic
items you normally couldn&rsquo;t employ.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Fast Hands: Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves&rsquo; tools
to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

          When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster
than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a
number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Use Magic Device: By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic
that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Thief&rsquo;s Reflexes: When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying
ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round
of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second
turn at your initiative minus 10. You can&rsquo;t use this feature when you are surprised.
