          The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast
one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the
spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long

spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-
level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting
the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

         <div class="story-block">
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a

       Improved Divine Smite: By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that
all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you
also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage
of your Divine Smite.

       content: Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the
cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin&rsquo;s training.
Some characters with this class don&rsquo;t consider themselves true paladins until they
have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the
oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin&rsquo;s
heart.

        content: The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,
virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors,
these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in
pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest
standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to
the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and
use their gods&rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels&mdash;the
perfect servants of good&mdash;as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.

          When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity
options.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          ***Sacred Weapon.*** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding
with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your
Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of
+1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet
beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the
duration.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no
longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect
ends.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          ***Turn the Unholy.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the
creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t
take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the
creature can use the Dodge action.

        <div class="story-block">
         A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most
virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding,
sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of
emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares
his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend
an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar
act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts
fresh.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the
consequences can be more serious. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, an impenitent paladin
might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.
