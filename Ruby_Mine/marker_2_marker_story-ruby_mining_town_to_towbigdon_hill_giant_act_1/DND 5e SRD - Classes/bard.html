         By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of
disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you
choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the
Spells Known column of the Bard table.

         Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of
knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether
singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these
bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the
audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true,
from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to
a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         The college&rsquo;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete
with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also
meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel
lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
        </div>
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Bonus Proficiencies: When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with three skills of your choice.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Cutting Words: Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature
that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a
damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic
Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from
the creature&rsquo;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its
roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds
or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it
can&rsquo;t hear you or if it&rsquo;s immune to being charmed.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Additional Magical Secrets: At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from
any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don&rsquo;t count
against the number of bard spells you know.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Peerless Skill: Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can
expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the
number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die
for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.
