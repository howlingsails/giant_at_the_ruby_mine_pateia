          The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

          You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal
to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must
be of a level for which you have spell slots.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-
level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six
spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
*cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the
spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a

minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

         Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when
your need is great.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Imploring your deity&rsquo;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance
you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention;
the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         If your deity intervenes, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise,
you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

        content: The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy&mdash;one of the
fundamental forces of the universe&mdash;that sustains all life. The gods of life promote
vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need,
and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can
claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as
Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-
Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and
Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

        Disciple of Life: Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more

          As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore
a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures
within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can
restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can&rsquo;t use this
feature on an undead or a construct.

        Blessed Healer: Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal
you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points
to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell&rsquo;s level.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Divine Strike: At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target.
When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
       </div>
       <div class="burgSummary speakToMeNow">
        Supreme Healing: Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more
dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible
for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you
restore 12.
