          The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st

         <div class="story-block">
          You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so,
choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          For example, if you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level
spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include
six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If
you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-level
or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared
spells.
         </div>
         <div class="story-block">
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a
new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing
the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per
spell level for each spell on your list.

        The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries
of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions
dedicated to its complex study.
       </div>
       <div class="story-block">
        The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of
magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them
into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally
schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across
town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like
academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even
wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division
of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require
mastery of different techniques.

as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast
enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak,
while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

        Sculpt Spells: Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety

affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1

throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half

        Potent Cantrip: Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures
that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw
against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip&rsquo;s damage (if any) but
suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

          Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you
cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum
damage with that spell.

          The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature
again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again
before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.
This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

         The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane
research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had
about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s
chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

        <div class="story-block">
         ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or
higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare
and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the
spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote
it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures
required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost
represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master
it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time
and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another
book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just
like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you
understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend
only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells
that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your
spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many
wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
        </div>
        <div class="story-block">
         ***The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with
its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional
leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-
edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes
scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
